add description
I would like to build a program that predicts the availability of a vélib bike at a specified location and the % chance of a parking vélib spot at another location. The predictability is based on historical data, with probable correlation on weather, historical use, day and time.
For example, the program asks for a departure station, date and time of departure and it outputs the current status of the station (number of ebikes and bikes and free parking spots), % probability for availability for each category (ebikes, bikes and free spots).
